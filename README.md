# DogBreederProjectPytorch
Using PyTorch for DogBreeder CNN on Udacity Course

This is final version after multiple iterations.
Data needs to be downloaded separately. It is not part of this repository.

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) exercise is the one used here. It is based on Pytorch
There are multiple steps.


    Step 0: Import Datasets
    Step 1: Detect Humans (using CV2)
    Step 2: Detect Dogs (using CV2)
    Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch) --- pytorch with transformation
    Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning) == using VGG16
    Step 5: Write your Algorithm
        Bad accuracy only 16%, but target is only 10%. 
    Step 6: Test Your Algorithm
        This is the best algorithm using VGG16, but it has 86% accuracy (target is 60%)
